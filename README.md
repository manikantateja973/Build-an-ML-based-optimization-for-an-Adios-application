# ML based optimization for an ADIOS application
Term project for CS553 Cloud Computing at Illinois Tech. This project deals with the deployment of HPC application on top of Hermes in the cloud. It shows the installtion of WRF, LAMMPS and OpenFOAM with ADIOS2 configurations and the deployment of these using Jarvis-cd.
This repository is divided into three sections for each of the HPC application and then the data collected for the LAMMPS when integrated with COEUS-ADAPTER.
